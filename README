[INTRO-1] Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library represents a collection of PRNG algorithms and my own algorithms
as I experiment on my own.  It was created on a whim, when Anastasia Richter
asked me for a random number generator Fall 2011.  PRNGs are a fundamental
technology in Computer Science, thus a deep understanding of them is desired.





[SAMPL-2] Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included alongside the source code are samples of the random byte produced by
different algorithms in the 'samples/' subfolder.  Currently included are a
'.bin' file representing the raw bytes from 'random_wolf1' and a corresponding
512x512 RGB interpretation encoded as a JPEG file with extension '.jpg'.

The samples were produced with the following two commands:

    $ ./wolf_random1.py 500000 b > random_wolf1.bin
    $ rawtoppm 512 512 random_wolf1.bin | ppmtojpeg > random_wolf1.jpg





[LICEN-3] License
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library is released under the Unlicense <www.unlicense.org>.  The terms
are explained in UNLICENSE.  Basically, this is public domain code and
documentation.  But it would be nice if you could cite me even if only in a
comment within your own source.
