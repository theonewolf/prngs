[INTRO-1] Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library represents a collection of PRNG algorithms and my own algorithsm as
I experiment on my own.  It was created on a whim, when Anastasia Richter asked
me for a random number generator Fall 2011.  PRNGs are a fundamental technology
in Computer Science, thus a deep understanding of them is desired.




[LICEN-5] License
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library is released under the Unlicense <www.unlicense.org>.  The terms are
explained in UNLICENSE.  Basically, this is public domain code and
documentation.  But it would be nice if you could cite me even if only in a
comment within your own source.
